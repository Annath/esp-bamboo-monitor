bamboo-monitor
==============

A simple tool for monitoring bamboo builds and notifying me visually of the outcome.

There's some simple arduino firmware for a visual indicator. Later on I want to add an [RGB LED Ring](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1586) as an indicator. Pictures of the prototype hardware for the project can be found on [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/Wr0SE).
